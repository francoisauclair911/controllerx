Each device supports a type of controller and this is what gives them the functionality over an entity. As for now, the two types of supported controllers are lights and media players.

Here you can check the specific parameters that each type of controller needs. Check the [configuration](configuration) page for the generic parameters.

## Light controller

This controller allows the devices to control light or group of lights. This allows you to:

- Turn on/off light(s)
- Toggle light(s)
- Manual increase/decrease of brightness and color
- Smooth increase/decrease (holding button) of brightness and color
- Color loop changing if the light supports xy color.

Values can be `color_temp`, `hs`, `xy`, `rgb`, `rgbw` and `rgbww`.                                                                                                                        |

| `color_mode` | string | `auto`          | This attribute can take `auto`, `xy_color` or `color_temp` as value. `auto` will check first if the light supports `xy_color` and then `color_temp`. `xy_color` will cicle through different colors infinitely. `color_temp` will change the color temperature attribute of the light. If a light supports both, user can pick which action wants for the light(s). |

_\* Required fields_

_Information about `color_wheel` attribute:_

This attribute can be either an string or a list. These are the possible string values:

| value | description |
| `default_color_wheel` | These are the 24 colors that appear in the circle color of home assistant. |
| `color_temp_wheel` | These are the xy colors translated from color temperature (2000K to 6488K). They were extracted from [here](https://www.waveformlighting.com/files/blackBodyLocus_1.txt). |

Otherwise, a custom xy color list can be defined like the following:

```yaml
example_app:
  module: controllerx
  class: < device class or LightController >
  controller: < your controller id >
  integration: < your integration >
  light: light.your_light
  color_wheel:
    - [0.525, 0.411]
    - [0.167, 0.338]
    - [0.324, 0.329]
```

## Media player controller

This allows you to control media players. It supports volume, play/pause and skipping forward/backward the track and the source.

Note that the maximum value is 1000 and if leaving to 0, you might get uncommon behavior.                                                                               |

_\* Required fields_

### "supported_features" field

This field will override the `supported_features` attribute from the entity (light, media player, etc). By default, ControllerX will check this value from Home Assistant, however, there are times that this attribute does not reflect properly the features that the entity supports. ControllerX automatically will select one action or another depending on this value, this is why it's important that reflects the supported features. This is defined as a bit field in Home Assistant, so its binary representation of the number will defined which features it supports. You can see the values for each entity below.

#### Light

| feature    | value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| EFFECT     | 4     |
| FLASH      | 8     |
| TRANSITION | 32    |

If you want to express support for everything, the value is `0b101100` or `44`.

| -------------------- | ------ |
| PAUSE                | 1      |

| SUPPORT_GROUPING     | 524288 |

If you want to express support for everything, the value is `0b1111111111110111111` or `524223`.

#### Cover

| feature            | value |
| ------------------ | ----- |

| SET_TILT_POSITION  | 128   |

If you want to express support for everything, the value is `0b11111111` or `255`.
